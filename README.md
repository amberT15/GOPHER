This repository contains scripts for data preprocessing, training deep learning models for DNA sequence to epigenetic function prediction and evaluation of models.

The repo contains a set of tutorial jupyter notebooks that illustrate these steps on a toy dataset, and should be completed in the order below:
- preprocessing/preprocessing/quant_dataset_tutorial.ipynb 
- tutorials/train_model.ipynb
- tutorials/evaluation.ipynb
