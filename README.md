This repository contains scripts for data preprocessing, training deep learning models for DNA sequence to epigenetic function prediction and evaluation of models.

The repo contains a set of tutorial jupyter notebooks that illustrate these steps on a toy dataset. The two notebooks below are required prerequisites for the rest of tutorials:
- preprocessing/preprocessing/quant_dataset_tutorial.ipynb
- tutorials/train_model.ipynb



download dataset.zip, trained_models.zip.
Put them inside this git directory and unzip without changing folder name
download and unzip training_dataset.zip and unzip within datasets.
All analysis output to ./figure_output/
